My new blogging venture on [Medium](https://medium.com/@matthewdiiulio) has been going very well. This time around I have been writting quality content about topics I care about, and people have responded very positvely to what I have published so far.

Medium has a beautiful design and has done a great job of getting eyeballs in fornt of my posts, but I still want my own home on the web. For now on, I will post here and syndicate to Medium and other social networks via [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

Check back regualry, I am going to start writting more posts here very soon.
